# Integrate Bifrost SLPx on Manta

## Getting started
Manta Pacific's SLPx currently does not support inter-contract calls. However, you can interact with the contract directly from the frontend. 


### Contract


Source code: [MantaPacificSlpx.sol](https://github.com/bifrost-io/slpx-contracts/blob/main/contracts/MantaPacificSlpx.sol)
ABI: [MantaPacificSlpx.json](https://github.com/bifrost-io/slpx-contracts/blob/main/deployments/manta/MantaPacificSlpx.json)

## Integration

8 - 10 mins wait time
