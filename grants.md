# Open Bounties & Requests for Proposals (RFPs)

Open Bounties and RFPs for specific ideas that are identified by Bifrost core contributors.  If you have the skills, expertise and experience to create, develop and deliver, we want to hear from you! **Its time to join our Revolution!**

## Ideas

- DeFi LST Data Dashboard - An interactive tool that compares yield and LP opportunities on Bifrost vs other LST protocols This tool would show current yield, historical yield, and other metrics.
- LST Yield trading protocol - Build a permissionless yield-trading protocol where users can execute various yield management strategies for their vTokens - fixed yield (i.e. earn fixed yield on vDOT), long yield (i.e. bet on vDOT yield going up by purchasing more yield). Examples like Pendle Finance, Spectra, Flashstake.
- Project LaunchPad - Build a project launchpad where projects obtain bootstrap funds by raising and locking vTokens to receive Staking Rewards. In return, vToken stakers will receive the project's Native Token. After the vToken lock-up period ends, it will be automatically returned to the stakers.
- Lossless Prediction Market - Build a Lossless Prediction Market for vToken, where users accumulate a fund pool using vToken's Staking Reward, and periodically earn rewards from the fund pool by predicting token prices or real-world assets or events.
- LST Backed Stablecoin - Build a decentralised yield bearing stablecoin backed by Bifrost vToken. Examples like Prisma Finance, Lybra Finance
- LST index - Build a dedicated swap and yield optimization platform for all Bifrost ecosystem vTokens. Deposit any Bifrost vToken and in return receive an index token. Examples like UnshETH.
- Asymmetric staking yield distribution protocol - “gamifying liquid staking” - Build a decentralised, non custodial protocol for asymmetric yields distribution generating from staking. Staking yield is periodically distributed by the protocol between pool participants randomly and asymmetrically making staking more fun. Examples like Asymetrix Protocol.
- LST yield strategies integration - Implement LST leveraged yield strategies in yield farming protocols (Yearn, InstaDapp, DeFi Saver, Harvest)
- On-chain game via LSTs - Create a simple fully onchain game PvP like “Rock, Paper, Scissors”  allowing players to wager vTokens staking rewards and play against each other.



## Evaluation of proposals

Bounties will be evaluated for:

- Demand or use case
- Technical feasibility and capability of the team, team track record
- Project timelines and execution schedule
- Competitiveness to similar bounty applications
- Innovation and uniqueness
- Vision (why build it? Is the project in line with the network’s overall goals?)
- Product license - who and how can make use of products originating from the bounty (for example, code produced by a bounty is open source? What license?)

## Bounty Lifecycle

- Go to the Issue section for this GItHub repo: https://github.com/zxstim/mono/issues
- Use the proposal template to create a proposal describing your idea.
- Upon receiving the `approved` tag for your issue, you can start working on the submission.
- Once you are done with your submission, submit the open source GitHub repo links and deployed links for your submission in the previously created Issue.
- Bounty will be evaluated by the Bounty Committee
    - Initial evaluation & feedback will be communicated with applicants up to 60 days from submission
        - re-submission and adjustments could be required.
- The Bounty Committee will vote on the approval of the application.
    - The committee can decide to accept the application in whole / partially or reject it.
- The Bounty Committee will communicate their decision (approval or rejection) to the applicant.
- Accepted bounty applications will be published on the [Bifrost forum](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/).
