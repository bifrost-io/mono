# Building on Polakdot Mini Hackathon

## Context
Bifrost is a Liquid Staking app-chain tailored for all blockchains, utilizing decentralized cross-chain interoperability to empower users to earn staking rewards and DeFi yields with flexibility, liquidity, and high security across multiple chains.

## Challenge details
**Design and implement a novel and high-quality user experience for interacting with Bifrost‚Äôs widely used liquid staking tokens in a multi-chain environment on Polkadot.** 

We encourage participating teams to prioritize a user-centric perspective, creating smooth and intuitive front-end interaction flows that support functions such as minting, redeeming, and real-time status tracking of liquid staking tokens.

To achieve this, you can:
- Building a new front-end interaction interface to optimize the overall user journey of Bifrost liquid staking
- Enabling visual monitoring and management of staked assets across multiple chains
- Designing clear and user-friendly data display and operation feedback mechanisms

## Judging criteria
- **Originality**: Whether the solution demonstrates innovation and differentiated design
- **User Experience**: Smoothness of interaction, clarity of visuals, and ease of use of functions
- **Technical Implementation**: Code completeness, architectural rationality, and functional stability

**Note:** AI-assisted development is allowed. However, please note that AI-generated content may have potential issues. Use it cautiously and conduct your own code review.

## Requirements
- The project must be fully open-source. All relevant code repository links must be provided upon submission.
- The same project may be submitted multiple times with optimized versions, but each submission must demonstrate key functional improvements.
- The project must be deployed on a Bifrost-compatible testnet or mainnet. In essence, Passet Hub and Moonbase Alpha (Moonbeam Testnet).

## Submission guidelines
- Go to the Issue section for this GitHub repo: https://github.com/bifrost-io/mono/issues
- Use the proposal template to create a proposal describing your idea. Include this short sentence at the end of your proposal title "- Dot Your Future: The Builder Party Hackathon".
- Upon receiving the `approved` tag for your issue, you can start working on the submission. Should be within 2-3 hours.
- Once you are done with your submission, submit the open source GitHub repo links and deployed links for your submission in the previously created Issue.
- Grant will be evaluated by the Grant Committee
    - Initial evaluation & feedback will be communicated with applicants as soon as possible from the date of submission.
    - Re-submission and adjustments could be required.
    - We will assign a grant amount based on the quality of the submission.
- The grant Committee will vote to approve payment of the proposal.
    - The committee can decide to accept the application in whole / partially or reject it.
- The Grant Committee will communicate their decision (approval or rejection) to the applicant. Your issue will be marked `cleared` after payout has been approved and `paid` after payout has been transferred.
- Accepted grant applications will be published on the [Bifrost forum](https://bifrost.subsquare.io/).
- For receiving the grant, you need to provide your Bifrost wallet address. Follow these steps:
  - Create a repository in your GitHub account named `bifrost-io`.
  - Create a file inside the repository named `funding.json`.
